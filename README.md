# fbits
Check for TRUE 24-bit audio files

This is script I found on the internet long time ago but never managed to rescue it until now.

Linux
- Create a new file called "fbits" and place it somewhere with enough privileges
- Copy and paste the script from [here](https://github.com/ALi3naTEd0/fbits/blob/main/fbits) into your fbits file and save it
- Make it executable:
   `sudo chmod +x /path/to/your/fbits`
  
   *Replace the path with your fbits script file location*
  
Now you can use it by just running `fbits *.flac` inside the folder you want to test

Or just
`fbits /your/music/path`

Windows
- Use [MSY2](https://www.msys2.org/)
